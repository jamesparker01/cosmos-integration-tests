# Cosmos integration tests

Just a small hacky project to test an Azure Cosmus using the Microsoft Cosmos local emulator. It requires the emulator to be installed and running.

More info on the local emulator: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator

I have leaned heavily on the example code from the example code here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-dotnet-v3/blob/master/Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos.Samples/Usage/ItemManagement/Program.cs
